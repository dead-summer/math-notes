= Integration

In the classical theory of integration on $bb(R) , integral_a^b f (x) dif x$ is defined as a limit of Riemann sums, which are integrals of functions that approximate $f$ and are constant on subintervals of $[a , b]$. Similarly, on any measure space there is an obvious notion of integral for functions that are, in a suitable sense, locally constant, and it can be extended to an integral for more general functions. In this chapter, we develop the theory of integration on abstract measure spaces, paying particular attention to the Lebesgue integral on $bb(R)$ and its generalization to $bb(R)^n$.
